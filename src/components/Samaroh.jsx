              an opportunity to showcase their work and the impact made within
              their community with their peers to a large audience, which will
              help in inspiring people across the nation to work toward waste
              management actively. In the first batch of the fellowship, the
              Mission selected 379 fellows but over the fellowship period, 344
              fellows were able to continue based on their ideas and action

              scientifically and sustainably. As ambassadors of change, these
              344 fellows conducted over 2700 sensitization programmes.
