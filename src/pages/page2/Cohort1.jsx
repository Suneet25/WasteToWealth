          <Text color={"gray.500"} fontSize={"lg"}>
            A total of 1062 applications were received from across the country
            (from Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Gujarat, the
            Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and more), for the 2021 Cohort. Out of
            the 1062 applications, 379 SSFs were selected from 27 States and 6
            Union Territories, based on their proposed ideas and action plans to
            tackle the challenge of waste management scientifically and
            sustainably. An 8-member expert committee (nominated by the Office
            of the PSA to the Government of India) evaluated a total of 3800
            reports submitted by the fellows and provided critical feedback on
            the portal to each fellow for improvements within their specific
            projects going forward, over a course of 12 months. Based on the
            evaluations and feedback on the individual project reports, the
            respective monthly fellowship amount was disbursed to the fellows
            across India.

            The SSF programme has demonstrated that citizens, young and old,
            have a great deal of interest and enthusiasm for working toward
            waste management. Numerous fellows have developed new ideas into
            products, prototypes, and technological innovations. Many of these
            fellows are eager to take their ideas further towards building their
            own start-ups. The fellows have demonstrated their entrepreneurial
            acumen by involving community workers, especially underprivileged
            people, and generating employment for them. The SSFs have been
            successful in encouraging their peers and the community to manage
            their waste by raising awareness through a variety of sensitization
            campaigns. The fellows have conducted their proposed activities
            quite actively and consider themselves the torchbearers of this
            programme because of this sensitisation through the award of the
            fellowship. The most admirable feature of the programme is the
            fellows' dedication to transforming "Waste to Wealth" through their
            modest but honest activities.

            Most of the SSFs have emphasised on the significance of waste
            segregation at source itself and have tried to raise awareness of
            the advantages of appropriate source segregation in the community.
            They claim that because of their actions, their friends, family,
            neighbours, and community members have now actively begun source
            segregation, which is assisting in the delivery of the segregated
            waste to the appropriate recycling and composting facilities. To
            provide solutions for efficient waste management, many SSFs have
            been collaborating closely with local authorities and other
            stakeholders from various organisations. The SSFsâ€™ initiatives have
            also resulted in a considerable change in society in terms of
            cleanliness. From time to time, fellows have been recognised for
            their waste-to-wealth initiatives. Many of their activities have
            also been publicised in the form of pamphlets, posters, and videos
            on social media platforms and via print media. The programme has
            reported a significant impact on the community/environment (homes,
            schools, villages, communities, industries) through increased
            community involvement which has led to positive behavioural changes
            of citizens towards effective waste management, a decrease in waste
            production, and cleanliness. The fellowship has produced a number of
            products and prototypes that the fellows can now develop further for
            commercialization and scaling up by utilising the platform and
            networking opportunities provided under the fellowship. The
            intention of the fellows to continue working for the cause in
            society beyond the fellowship term is what is most inspiring. Many
            of them have plans to advance their innovative ideas/solutions
            towards validation and towards the start-up level, to make a
            noticeable difference in society. The most significant
            accomplishment of this programme is the instillation of a culture of
            waste management among the fellows.
